## Overview
This HTML project represents a **Nutrition Facts** label with detailed information about servings, calories, daily value percentages, and other essential nutrients like fats, cholesterol, sodium, carbohydrates, sugars, protein, and vitamins. The design follows a clean and modern look that aligns with standard nutrition labels.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: For structuring the webpage.
- **CSS3**: For styling and layout (linked externally via `styles.css`).
- **Google Fonts**: Uses the "Open Sans" font for modern typography.

## Setup Instructions
To run this project locally:

1. **Clone or download the project files**:
   
2. **Open the HTML file**:
   Navigate to the downloaded folder and open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser. The CSS is linked externally in the `styles.css` file.

3. **Customize** (optional):
   Modify the `styles.css` file to make visual changes to the label as per your requirements.

## File Structure
```
|-- index.html       # Main HTML structure for the nutrition label
|-- styles.css       # External stylesheet for the label
```

- **index.html**: Contains the HTML code defining the layout and structure of the nutrition label.
- **styles.css**: Defines the styles such as fonts, padding, spacing, and divider design.

## Customization
You can easily customize the nutrition label for different food products by editing the values in the HTML. For example, update the serving size, calories, or daily value percentages directly within the `<p>` tags.

### Example:
To change the **Calories** value, modify:
```html
<p>Calories</p>
<span>230</span>
```
